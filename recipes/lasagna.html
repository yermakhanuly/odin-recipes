        <li>3 cups shredded mozzarella cheese</li>
        <li>1/2 cup grated Parmesan cheese</li>
    </ul>
    <h1>Instructions</h1>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 375°F (190°C).</li>
        <li>In a Dutch oven, cook the ground beef, sausage, and garlic over medium heat until well browned. Drain excess fat.</li>
        <li>Stir in crushed tomatoes, tomato paste, tomato sauce, and water. Season with sugar, basil, Italian seasoning, 1 teaspoon salt, and pepper. Simmer for about 30 minutes.</li>
        <li>In a mixing bowl, combine ricotta cheese with egg, remaining parsley, and 3/4 teaspoon salt.</li>
        <li>To assemble, spread 1 1/2 cups of meat sauce in the bottom of a 9x13 inch baking dish. Arrange 6 noodles lengthwise over meat sauce. Spread with one half of the ricotta cheese mixture. Top with a third of mozzarella cheese slices. Spoon 1 1/2 cups meat sauce over mozzarella, and sprinkle with 1/4 cup Parmesan cheese. Repeat layers and top with remaining mozzarella and Parmesan cheese.</li>
        <li>Cover with foil: to prevent sticking, either spray foil with cooking spray, or use a piece of parchment paper under the foil.</li>
        <li>Bake in preheated oven for 25 minutes. Remove foil, and bake an additional 25 minutes. Cool for 15 minutes before serving.</li>
        <li>Enjoy your homemade lasagna!</li>
